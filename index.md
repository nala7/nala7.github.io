# About

I'm Nadia Gonzalez Fernandez, a master's student at the University of Montreal under the supervision of professor Benoit Baudry. My thesis work focuses on software diversity and I'm an enthusiast of the Ethereum community. 

Currently, I'm carrying out a study on how software diversity is enforced into the pipeline of Ethereum clients and their developers' culture, from the code to the coordination of different developer teams. The objective is to shed light on the benefits and importance of software diversity, as well as on the technical and cultural challenges to let it happen.

This is the home page. It can be used for a short introduction. [Click here](cv) to see the full CV, and [here](assets/files/cv.pdf) to download a print version. The theme also ships with a blog: [click here](posts) to scroll posts from the most recent. Finally, [click here](404) to see a page that can't be found.

By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories).
