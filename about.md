I'm Nadia Gonzalez Fernandez, a research master's student at the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) in [DIRO](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/). I work under the supervision of professor [Benoit Baudry](https://softwarediversity.eu/). My thesis work focuses on software diversity and I'm an enthusiast of the Ethereum community. 

Currently, I'm carrying out a study on how software diversity is enforced into the pipeline of Ethereum clients and their developers' culture, from the code to the coordination of different developer teams. The objective is to shed light on the benefits and importance of software diversity, as well as on the technical and cultural challenges to let it happen.
